            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a web developer with a strong background in cryptocurrency support and technical specialization. Over the past five years, I've worked with platforms like ShapeShift.io, Mandala, and SimpleDEFI, where I've focused on improving customer support and contributing to platform growth.</p>
            <p>I enjoy building practical applications that integrate with APIs and visualize data. Most of my work revolves around Python, Flask, and tools like Matplotlib. I also have experience in data analysis, primarily in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I’m always learning something new, whether it's diving deeper into web development or exploring programming languages like Rust. I like creating projects that solve real problems, and I’m always up for a new challenge.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in what I do, feel free to check out my projects or get in touch.</p>
